# Memory Game Project

## Table of Contents

This is the classic game of Memory or MATCHING GAME.  Flip two cards over and see if they match.  If they do not, the cards will flip back over.  
Remember where the cards were and try again.  Each flipping of a pair counts as a turn.  The objective of the game is to match all 16 cards in the least of amount of turns and in the least amount of time.
You are given a star rating based on the amount of turns it took you.  You may restart the game at anytime by pressing the 'rounded arrow' at the top.

Have fun in nostalgia!

There is not much Version Control evidence because I forgot about it while figuring out this project.  I tried to make a few changes at the end just to demonstrate I can use it.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
